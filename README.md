Clock
=============

A simple clock abstraction library for PHP.

# Motivation
The problem with DateTime instances is that they are not testable and mockable. They always rely on the system date and time.  Therefore you should never directly create DateTime instances.


# Installation

Install it using Composer.
```
composer install intriro/clock
```

# Implementation

The `Clock` object provides access to the current date and time. Basically it is just a object which return a DateTimeImmutable instance with the current date and time.

With a Clock object you can always swap implementations and get DateTimeImmutable instances which don't rely on the system time.

The library ships with a `Clock` interface and two implementations.

`SystemClock` which gives you the access to the system date and time. It just returns `new DateTimeImmutable('now')` and it's the default implementation.

`FixedClock` which always returns a predefined fixed date and time and is ment for testing purposes.

# Example

```php

class Event
{
    /**
     * @var DateTimeImmutable
     */
    private $date;

    public function hasPassed(Clock $clock): bool
    {
        if ($this->clock->getCurrentDateTime() > $this->date) {
            return true;
        }
        
        return false;
 Â  Â }
}
```
